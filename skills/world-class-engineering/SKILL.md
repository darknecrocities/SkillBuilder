## 1.6 Antigravity Slash Command Synergy Strategy

To achieve maximum output quality, combine Antigravity native commands with specialized modular skills in a single prompt:

- **Full-Scale Feature Planning**: `/plan /full-scale-mode` (or `/plan /world-class-engineering`)
  - Activates Antigravity's interactive planning engine while strictly enforcing the 3-phase Triad Cadence, token budget ceilings, and subagent orchestration.
- **Modern Luxury UI & Apple Craftsmanship**: `/plan /ui /3d <product showcase>`
  - Combines Cupertino blur acrylic materials with WebGL PBR clearcoat 3D rendering for Tesla/Apple caliber interactive experiences.
- **Full-Stack Vertical Slice**: `/plan /fullstack /database /backend <feature>`
  - Guarantees zero mock arrays, real SQLite/PostgreSQL schemas, Zod API contracts, and optimistic frontend mutations.
- **Architectural Alignment Interview**: `/grill-me /world-class-engineering <system>`
  - Triggers an interactive Socratic design review to resolve trade-offs before generating code.

## 2. Engineering Operating System (EOS)

For every non-trivial task, strictly execute through these six phases:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Phase A: Understand"] --> B["Phase B: Define"]
    B --> C["Phase C: Plan"]
    C --> D["Phase D: Implement"]
    D --> E["Phase E: Verify"]
    E --> F["Phase F: Deliver"]
```

### Phase A: Understand
- Inspect the codebase structure, package manifests, and dependency trees.
- Identify the language runtime, framework version, build system, and test runner.
- Read existing test patterns, style configs, and architectural conventions.
- Locate configuration, environment variables, and external integration points.
- Map the exact, minimal set of files requiring modification.
- **Never** assume a stack without checking. **Never** rewrite working code simply because another pattern looks newer.

### Phase B: Define
- Formulate explicit, testable acceptance criteria covering:
  - Functional requirements and contracts (inputs, outputs, states).
  - Non-functional requirements (latency, throughput, memory).
  - Security boundaries, authentication, and authorization rules.
  - Edge cases, error modes, and backward compatibility.
- If critical context is missing, ask a focused clarifying question. Otherwise, state reasonable assumptions explicitly and proceed.

### Phase C: Plan
- For non-trivial modifications, draft a technical design using [templates/implementation-plan.md](templates/implementation-plan.md).
- Specify module boundaries, data flow, API contracts, dependencies, and testing strategies.
- Omit formal planning only for trivial one-line fixes.

### Phase D: Implement
- Write minimal, production-ready code that satisfies the acceptance criteria.
- Adhere strictly to the [500-Line Source File Policy](#3-the-500-line-source-file-policy).
- Reuse established project abstractions; do not invent redundant helpers.
- Avoid speculative functionality, premature abstractions, and unrequested refactors.

### Phase E: Verify
- Run unit, integration, and E2E tests relevant to the changed modules.
- Run type-checkers, linters, and formatters.
- Run the source file line counter: `python3 scripts/check_source_line_limits.py --path <project>`.
- **Never** claim a check passed without inspecting its output. If a check cannot be run, disclose why and state the remaining risk.

### Phase F: Deliver
- Provide an honest summary using [references/delivery-checklist.md](references/delivery-checklist.md):
  - Exact changes made and files created or modified.
  - Architecture decisions and trade-offs.
  - Tests executed and exact commands run.
  - Unresolved issues, limitations, or required environment configurations.

## 3. The Multi-Tiered Code Quality & 500-Line Maintainability Matrix

### The Double Mandate (Human Maintainability + AI Attention Fidelity)
In modern software engineering, file size limits are driven by a dual necessity:
1. **Human Maintainability (Empirical Defect Density)**: Historical research (Ostrand/Weyuker/Bell, McConnell's *Code Complete*) demonstrates that defect density climbs non-linearly when files exceed 400–500 physical lines. Files crossing this threshold routinely violate the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, accumulating hidden coupling and mutative side effects.
2. **AI Agent Reliability & Context Fidelity**: In agentic pair-programming (Google Antigravity, Gemini 3.8 Flash High, Claude, Cursor), bloated files trigger **Context Rot** and "Lost-in-the-Middle" degradation. When files exceed 600 lines, token costs spike, attention weights stretch, and tool-call diff replacements (`edit_file`) become fragile due to repeated ambiguous boilerplate.

### The 4-Tier Maintainability Matrix

| Tier | Physical Line Range | Architectural Classification | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1: Sweet Spot** | **$150 - 250$ lines** | Optimal Cohesion | Ideal target for UI components, custom hooks, and domain services. Maximum readability and AI attention. |
| **Tier 2: Nominal** | **$251 - 350$ lines** | Acceptable Complexity | Typical for rich services, data repositories, and state machines with comprehensive type safety. |
| **Tier 3: Warning Zone** | **$351 - 499$ lines** | Approaching Ceiling | Proactive `/refactor` flag. Review for subcomponent extraction, helper delegation, or hook isolation. |
| **Tier 4: Hard Ceiling** | **$\le 500$ lines** | Non-Negotiable Gate | Strict CI/CD build barrier (`check_source_line_limits.py`). Zero files $>500$ lines permitted in production. |

### Domain-Specific Target Ceilings
- **UI / Presentation Components (React, Flutter, Compose, SwiftUI)**: **$\le 250$ lines**. Extract subviews, styled wrappers, and custom hooks.
- **Domain Services / Use Cases**: **$\le 300$ lines**. Pure business rules; zero HTTP transport or database leaks.
- **Repositories & Data Access**: **$\le 350$ lines**. Focused queries, schema mapping, and expand/contract migration steps.
- **Declarative Schemas & Contracts (OpenAPI, Prisma, Types)**: **$\le 500$ lines**. Group related types into modular domain slices.

### Cognitive Complexity & Function Hygiene Guardrails
- **Function / Method Length**: Maximum **$40$ physical lines**. Functions must do one cohesive task.
- **Nesting Depth**: Maximum **$3$ levels**. Enforce guard clauses and early returns (`if (!valid) return;`).
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Maximum **$10$** independent execution paths per function. Eliminate complex cascading ternary ladders.
- **Function Parameters**: Maximum **$3$ positional parameters**. Use typed option/config interfaces for 4+.

### In-Scope Extensions
- TypeScript / JavaScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`)
- Python (`.py`)
- Go (`.go`)
- Rust (`.rs`)
- Java / C# (`.java`, `.cs`)
- Dart / Kotlin / Swift (`.dart`, `.kt`, `.swift`)

### Exclusions & Legitimate Exceptions
- Auto-generated code, lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`), migrations, snapshots, database schemas/DDL dumps, minified assets, datasets, and static configuration/documentation.
- When an exception is necessary due to external framework constraints or generated code, document the rationale in the pull request or delivery report.

### 7-Step Refactoring Protocol
When a source file exceeds 350 lines or approaches the 500-line ceiling:
1. **Identify Cohesive Responsibilities**: Deconstruct the file into distinct concerns (e.g., business logic, data persistence, HTTP parsing, validation).
2. **Determine Module Boundaries**: Design clean, cohesive target modules with intuitive names.
3. **Extract Modules**: Move sub-responsibilities into focused sibling files or subpackages.
4. **Preserve Public Contracts**: Maintain the existing public API via re-exports or facade modules to avoid breaking downstream consumers.
5. **Update References**: Update import statements, export manifests, and test fixtures.
6. **Execute Verification**: Run the project's test suite and lint checks to confirm behavioral equivalence.
7. **Validate Line Count**: Run `scripts/check_source_line_limits.py --show-tiers` to confirm all resulting files are compliant.

## 4. Autonomous Subagent Division of Labor

When orchestrating multi-agent workflows or subagent delegations, assign clear, non-overlapping roles:

```text
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│  Architect   │ ──> │ Implementer  │ ──> │Test Engineer │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
                            │                     │
                            v                     v
                     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
                     │Sec Reviewer  │     │Code Reviewer │
                     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

1. **Architect**: Analyzes requirements, defines module boundaries, and authors the technical plan.
2. **Implementer**: Writes the minimal production code adhering to the architecture and 500-line limit.
3. **Test Engineer**: Authors independent unit, integration, and regression test suites.
4. **Security Reviewer**: Analyzes trust boundaries, input validation, authentication, and secret hygiene.
5. **Code Reviewer**: Evaluates code against the prioritized rubric in [references/code-review.md](references/code-review.md).
6. **Documentation Reviewer**: Ensures setup guides, ADRs, and API contracts reflect reality.

### Simultaneous Multi-Agent Synchronization & Storage Safety Rules:
- **Zero Overlapping File Edits**: Concurrent subagents must never modify the same file simultaneously; partition ownership strictly by domain track.
- **Idempotent Single-Slot Backups (Zero Spam)**: When multiple subagents interact with databases, Firebase, Supabase, AWS, or GCP storage, they coordinate through `.backups/backup_manifest.json` (`manage_deduplicated_backup.py`). If the resource's SHA-256 state digest is unchanged, agents reuse the existing canonical backup without creating duplicate `.bak.1`, `.bak.2` copies.
- **Sensitive Deletion Human-in-the-Loop Gate**: Subagents must halt and notify the user first (disclosing target resource, sensitivity tier, affected scope, and verified backup SHA-256 hash) before executing any hard delete, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, or bucket/collection purge.

*Rule*: Do not spawn subagents for trivial tasks. The primary agent retains final accountability for integrating, verifying, and reporting all work.

## 5. The 7 Quality Gates

Before declaring any feature or bugfix complete, evaluate against these 7 gates:

- [ ] **GATE 1 — REQUIREMENTS**: Explicit, testable criteria verified.
- [ ] **GATE 2 — ARCHITECTURE**: Clear boundaries, high cohesion, low coupling, no circular deps.
- [ ] **GATE 3 — IMPLEMENTATION**: Clean, readable, within the 500-line ceiling.
- [ ] **GATE 4 — CORRECTNESS**: Automated tests pass, edge cases handled, zero uninspected failures.
- [ ] **GATE 5 — SECURITY**: Input validated at boundaries, least privilege enforced, zero hardcoded secrets.
- [ ] **GATE 6 — MAINTAINABILITY**: No speculative abstractions, no dead code, no code duplication.
- [ ] **GATE 7 — DELIVERY**: Verified output documented, migration steps stated, limitations disclosed.

## 6. Installation & Mandatory Enforcement

### Option A: Global Installation (Available across all projects on your machine)
Copy or symlink this skill directory to your global Antigravity config directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/config/skills
cp -r path/to/world-class-engineering ~/.gemini/config/skills/
```

### Option B: Project-Level Installation (Checked into Git for your team)
Place the skill inside the `.agents/skills/` directory of your project repository:

### Mandatory Enforcement via `AGENTS.md`
To make this engineering discipline **mandatory for every session**, add the following rule to your project's root `AGENTS.md` (or globally in your workspace configuration):

```markdown
# Mandatory Engineering Discipline

All software architecture, implementation, refactoring, and verification tasks MUST adhere strictly to the `world-class-engineering` skill:
- Follow the 6-phase Engineering Operating System (Phase A through F).
- Enforce the 500-line source file limit using `scripts/check_source_line_limits.py`.
- Apply defense-in-depth security and independent test verification before delivery.
- Run all 7 Quality Gates before reporting work as complete.
```
